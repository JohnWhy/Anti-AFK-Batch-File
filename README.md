# Anti-AFK-Batch-File
I've streamlined the process by removing the need to install python (Apparently some people don't have admin perms at work! Who'd have thought!?)

Basically, if you have any lock-downs stopping you from making yourself permanently "online" then run this script to double press the "num-lock" every 5 mins or so.  This will keep your keyboard active even if you're staring into space at your desk.

# Usage

Literally just download the .bat file anywhere on your windows machine, and double click it.
